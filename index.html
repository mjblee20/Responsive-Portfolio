                A great question and it is one that most people spend their whole life attempting answer. I do not have an answer to that myself as I am currently in the process of reinventing myself, hopefully/definitely for the better. I am born and raised in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. When I was 13 years old, my family immigrated to Seattle and I've stayed here ever since. I love it here.
